# Process

## Changing Ownership

As of Jan 2023, If you purchase a Rivian from a third-party you must email Rivian a copy of the
bill of sale and a copy of your drivers license. The process takes 7-10 days.. so do it ASAP after
purchase.

## Service Technician

Currently, costs for a mobile Rivian Service Technician to show up for a non-warranty covered
trip are a steep $700+.  Talk to customer service and make sure your work is covered by warranty.

# Known Problems

## Charging

As of April 2023, If you have a time-based charging schedule on your level 2 EVSE, the Rivian can
refuse to charge when your EVSE activates (the vehicle being locked and trying to provide power
might be the fault scenario). It's recommended to not use EVSE-based scheduling and use the Rivian's
built-in scheduling to resolve this.

## Automatic Tonneau Cover

The automatic Tonneau cover sold on early vehicles *will* jam and fail with dirt + age.
Rivian is currently working on a free fix for existing vehicles.

Until then, if your Tonneau cover works today and hasn't been locked out by Rivian. Take these
steps ASAP while it is still functional.

* Buy a can (or two) of WD-40 Specialist Dry Lube with PTFE.
* Clean off any grime or debris with Tonneau closed.
* Spray in-between each panel section with the straw nozzle.
* Open the Tonneau.
* Spray the tracks on either side using the straw nozzle.
* Spray around the front edge of the Tonneau track on either side.
* Wipe off excess. Close the Tonneau.
* Repeat every month or two to buy yourself time.

If your Tonneau jams, contact Rivian service. They'll open it fully and lock it out until
the final solution is released.
